## How to Run the Code

To run this project successfully, please follow these steps:

1. **Install Conda (if not already installed)**

   If you do not have Conda installed, download and install **Miniconda** from the official website:

   - [Miniconda Download Page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

   Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the installation instructions.

   Once installed, you can verify the installation by running:

   ```bash
   conda --version

2. **Create the Environment:**

   Use the provided `requirements.yml` file to create a Conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f requirements.yml

3. **Activate the environment**

    Activate the environment by typing out the following command in your terminal

    ```bash
   conda activate <environment_name>

4. **Note:**

   *All* the code that you will find in this .ipynb file is my own. However, I need certain utility functions to run this code. All the utility functions are found in the utils directory. The functions I use from utils are not my own!
